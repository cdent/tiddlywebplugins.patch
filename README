TiddlyWeb plugin to allow HTTP PATCH on TiddlyWeb entities.

By default tiddlers are edited and created with PUT, wherein
the request represents the full tiddler resource. In general 
this is sufficient, but there are times when it may be useful
to adjust just one attribute.

For this plugin a PATCH is a JSON dictionary document containing
one or more key and value pairs where the key is an attribute and
the value is a complete replacement for that value[1]. For those
entities where the entity has nested dictionaries, the deepest key
is replaced, not the top key.

[1] Several different options for how to do this were considered and
this was considered the least ambiguious and onerous. See
